# ☕☕ CoffeeApp Project ☕☕

### Description
This project is an application built based on requests sent to an API and the data received from the API. The application utilizes two different endpoints. The first one is the coffee/hot endpoint, which corresponds to hot coffees. The second one is the coffee/iced endpoint, responsible for retrieving iced coffees. On the homepage, separate lists are created for these two types of coffees. When a user clicks on a specific coffee, they can access the description and ingredients of that coffee.
